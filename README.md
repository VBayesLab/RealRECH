This repository includes the code that implements Bayesian inference and forecasting for the RealRECH model
Three folders SMC_for_GARCH, SMC_for_RealGARCH and SMC_for_RECH contain the implementation of SMC algorithm for fitting GARCH, RealGARCh and RECH (with realized measure) respectively.
Run SP500_analysis to reproduce the empirical results for SP500 data.
